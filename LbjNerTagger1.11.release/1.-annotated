This should allow you access to the library 's databases without going through the proxy bit . 
The [ORG Terminal Server  ] , once you have it set up ( yes , there is an initial setup involved ) , will bring the [ORG Haas  ] desktop with all its applications to your desktop . 
You can now use all the software that is available to you in [ORG Haas Computer Lab  ] from your home . 
If it works as promised ( boy , I sound jaded ! ) , you will really like it . 
Caveat: I have not tried using the [ORG Terminal Server  ] from off-campus yet , so I can't say with absolute assurance that the databases will in fact be available remotely as well . 
To use the terminal server , you have to be using [MISC Internet Explorer  ] version 5.0 or above and Windows 2000 and you will be directed to download and install the server 's client . 
If you try it and it works for you , send me an email . 
I don't have Windows at home and can't test it from here myself . 
[PER Monica Singh  ]
