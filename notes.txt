Quick Notes

1. Out of the first 100,000 files scanned, no 2 "started" with the same message-ID.

2. However, if we look at all the "Message-ID" fields contained in an email. Then, if 2 files share the same "Message-ID" somewhere in the file, it was found that they are usually very similar to each other. (Differing mainly in the main message-ID and the X-folder fields).
e.g. /Users/arindam/workplace/CS499/enron_mail_20110402/maildir/beck-s/discussion_threads/269. 
        /Users/arindam/workplace/CS499/enron_mail_20110402/maildir/beck-s/all_documents/302.
                have the Message-ID <OF164C0D1F.8D21ED53-ON862569E4.005A3F31@enron.com>
                However in this case 
                /Users/arindam/workplace/CS499/enron_mail_20110402/maildir/campbell-l/sent/461. 
                /Users/arindam/workplace/CS499/enron_mail_20110402/maildir/campbell-l/sent/460.
                they have the same message ID's appearing in the message, but are sent to 2 different recipients.

                3. The inbox and sent folders of the emails (of the first 100,000 which may include all such mails) didn't have same "Message-IDs" occurring in them.

                4. How to handle emails which have other emails embedded in them. For example forwards. Or in someone's inbox, the email might be the continuation of some other email thread.


                Stats:

                For each user:
                - How many outgoing messages does he have
                - How many incoming messages does he have
                - Is his folder in the dataset
                - Number of different people emailing to him
                - Number of different people he has emailed

                Total how many email:
                How many emails per folder (e.g. inbox, sent, discussion_items)
