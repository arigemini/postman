  \Abstract{A Customer Mix Algorithm (CMX) makes use of machine learning techniques to \
accurately determine whether messages intended to a specific customer are actually \ 
sent to a different customer. Detection of such messages has high value as this type of messages is considered \
harmful. In this project, we explore various machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods to determine the \
recipient of a message from the content, so that we can prevent messages from being sent to an incorrect recipient.}

  	I am extremely thankful to Prof. Dan Roth for being my advisor and guiding me through this thesis. He has pointed me to various useful resources  that has increased my breadth of knowledge in the field of machine learning. Also, the dataset used to evaluate various training algorithms is the Enron Email Dataset and I am thankful to the CALO Project (A Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes) for making that available. I am grateful to all the teachers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for the various concepts in the field of Computer Science that I have learned over the past four years. Finally, I would like to thank my family for their encourgament and support.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Customer Mix Algorithm}

A Customer Mix Algorithm (CMX) makes use of machine learning techniques to accurately determine whether messages intended to a specific customer are actually sent to a different customer. Such messages can be harmful for the sender and hence, being able to identify such messages are of high value. 

\section{Resources}

We use the Enron email dataset \cite{enrondataset} as our source of data. The next section presents various statistics about this large dataset of emails. \
We use SNoW (Sparse Network of Winnows) \cite{snow} to do training on the data. SNoW has well-known machine learning algorithms already implemented, \
namely Winnow, Perceptron and Naive Bayes, and is extremely efficient when training on large datasets. We also use the Illinois named entity tagger \cite{nertagger} to extract features from emails and use in  training. 

\chapter{Analysis of the dataset}

The input data for developing the Customer Mix Algorithm consists of the Enron data set \cite{enrondataset}. It is a massive collection of emails sent between the Enron employees and in this chapter we present various statistics about the data.

\section{Statistics}

The Enron dataset has  a total of 517424 emails across 150 accounts. Each account has messages grouped by various folder types (e.g. inbox, sent, etc...). We did an analysis of the distribution and the results are in the tables below (we only show the top 20).
